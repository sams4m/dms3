# Homework

### 1. how will you make the sound design for your AT2 function in a chaotic aesthetic register?Â  What does it mean to be chaotic in the sonic domain? In your discussion, please make reference to:

> - effective complexity, paying particular attention to:\

    - structure - whatÂ _structures_Â our perception of sound?\
    - noise - what differentiatesÂ noiseÂ fromÂ sound, or music?\
    - voice - what makesÂ _voice_Â a separate category of sound?

> - the role of de-familiarisation (as per Natalie Loveless' talkÂ [From Relational to Ecological Form](https://youtu.be/whzD1EPBVLk))

> - three examples, which can (but don't have to) be taken from the following list:\

    - MyNoise Generators:Â [Jungle](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/jungleNoiseGenerator.php)Â /Â [Water](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/healingWaterSoundscapeGenerator.php)Â /Â [Fire](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/fireNoiseGenerator.php)Â /Â [Thunder](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/thunderNoiseGenerator.php)Â /Â [Storm](https://mynoise.net/NoiseMachines/stormSoundGenerator.php)\
    - [Pink](https://dood.al/pinktrombone)\
    - [How to Kill a Zombie.](https://lcld.xyz/240831_how_to_kill)

Effective complexity in itself is a range balance between high structure and high randomness. In the case of sound I'd say that is a state between fine-tuned wavelengths vs interference to this wavelength. Kind of like when adjusting a radio and you're trying to find the right wavelength to listen into the channel that you want you'll often encounter a lot of 'noise' before getting the right wavelength and you can hear the voice/sound a lot more clearly.

The concept of de-familiarisation is a technique which presents familiar things in unfamiliar ways. This is to enhance the audience's perception and create new awareness of the subject. In this context, this would mean manipulating something familiar to create a fresh experience.

### 2. Implement an interactive sound design experiment in your blog.

> - you will need to get some form of user gesture for Web Audio API to run.
> - you can use a library, such asÂ [Tone.jsLinks to an external site.](https://tonejs.github.io/)Â orÂ [Pizzicato.js](https://alemangui.github.io/pizzicato), or you can useÂ [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API), orÂ [AudioWorklet](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AudioWorklet).
> - use a sinusoid to push your sound design into chaos and back every 24 seconds.
> - explain your code with the help of syntax-highlighted, commented code blocks
> - evaluate the success of your experiment with reference to your discussion in task 1
