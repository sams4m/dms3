# Homework

Post on your blog about how your AT3 is progressing.¬† Include the following concepts in your discussion:

> Communities of Practice
>
> - Domain
> - Repertoire
> - Values
> - Brokering

> Mycelial Creativity
>
> - Omnidirectional growth
> - Accumulative growth
> - Transformational growth
> - Fruiting Body

Assignment 3 is coming along pretty well, with more work submissions that I can add to the project! I have been working on reaching out to and brokering with more people, though I've found that it is a pretty busy period for most people around me so I'm not really confident that I'll get a lot of responses, but I'm hoping to get a few more. I've asked both online through private messages and in person at uni (in other classes and in the study area). I also sent a message through the discord channel, as i thought that the class has gotten to know and get along with each other quite well by now (at least those who frequent and interact in class). I'd say, this community of practice is quite diverse, as it includes a range of people that I've known over the years (some over a decade long). And are people that I find that I have a sort of feedback loop dynamic where we kind of mutually inspire each other and bounce ideas back and forth.

On top of hoping to get more submissions in general, I'm also hoping to get a wider variety of submissions too, this way I can really visually reflect the wide diversity in ideas, mediums, cultures and expressions that come under the umbrella domain of this community, and really create an effective fruiting body to promote omnidirectional sparks of inspiration for others when I "give back" this portfolio to everyone else -- not limited to those who have contributed.

Even though it's been a bit of a struggle to get responses at this point in time, I've found that everyone has found it to be a great idea --it's gotten everyones stamp of approval. Which I think enforces the point that this community of practice has a strong cross-disciplinary repertoire that's open to collaboration and supportive in experimentation of ideas, alongside holding strong to their values of authenticity and curiosity to learn from the experiences and people around us. And so while I haven't been getting as many responses as I'd hoped, I'm still really excited to see this through with everyone support.

# Assignment 3

With more submissions, I've started adding more pages. The pages are all in a seperate folder in an attempt to keep the code space cleaner, and more organised. The pages also has it's own pages css and a script that handles the little info/bio card. I've made it so that you can hit close to minimise the card to a little bubble so that the user can view the whole artwork on the screen with minimal obstruction, and open it back up if they want to view the person's name / bio again.

<div id="codeblock0"> </div>

> Pages CSS styling.

<div id="codeblock1"> </div>

> Pages JS Script.

The easiest to implement and sort out the layout for are those that shared images. Those have been added either in flex grids with 1-4 columns, depending on the amount of work people have shared (I was shocked but not surprised when a friend shared a whole folder filled with past work).

Those that are in a video, webpage or pdf format I've embedded them in. For youtube videos I've set it to auto start playing but with sound muted so that users aren't immediately shocked with sound playing. PDF's I've embedded without the controls to avoid easy downloading. For Adrian's webpage that he shared however, I've instead embedded the youtube play through of his work and added a link to the webpage for those interested to know more. I thought that this would be more engaging that blocks of text. (Sorry Adrian)

I also got two more submissions from class, bringing the number of submissions up to 8. I am hoping to get to the double digits though, so fingers crossed.

One thing that I added/changed was adding interaction to the close "button" for the window. I made the close button on the playground and about page "usable", where if you click on it it goes back to the landing page. I thought it'd be a fun detail to add that also makes the design more functional.

This was done by adding the inline script with the button svg:

```html
onclick="window.location.href=`index.html`;" class="back-btn"
```

And the CSS class was added into the global css file:

```CSS
/* BACK BUTTON --------------------------------------------------------*/

.back-btn {

cursor: pointer;

}



/* hover interaction */

.back-btn:hover {

color: var(--colour-4);

transition: 5ms ease-in-out;

}
```

---

However, with the amount of content that I now have on the playground page, I've found that the folders lag a bit, and I'm wondering if thats because the project is getting quite big and I have quite a few things in the Github repo to begin with, which may be causing it to lag. I'm thinking to move the project into a new repo to see if it'll manage a bit better, along with changing the folders int he playground page from svgs to pngs instead.

I also realised the website also isn't really mobile phone friendly... My plan is to at least get the desktop version done by the assignment due date, and if possible implement some web-responsive resizing of things, but when I started I focused more on getting the website working and done, and it's only now that I have it working that I realised that I completely forgot about web response. I think if I can't get to making it mobile friendly before the due date, I'll definitely work on it after semester and grading is over, since I think this is a really cool project to have to share with people, and usually I'd have my phone on me to show people, not a laptop.

<iframe id="at3" src="https://sams4m.github.io/comm2747-cr-coding/at3/"></iframe>

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`at3`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

> The current at3 web project. It isn't very small screen friendly though, would recommend opening in a full screen window in a [web browser](https://sams4m.github.io/comm2747-cr-coding/at3/).

---

I also started working on the about page, which I started with drafting the contents before implementing it in the project.

Layout wise, it follows the landing page quite closely, so it wasn't too complicated, I essentially copied the index.html file and changed it to about.html. And from there I changed the contents to the the about text and added some styling.

At this stage, there isn't a lot of styling, so I added it to the index styling file, but I did find that I was starting to get confused with things (probably also because I wasn't fully adding comments on what styles were too) so I think I may go back and seperate it to its own file after to mitigate confusion but also adjust the html code, as I think theres more divs and classes than I actually really need...

<div id="codeblock2"> </div>

> About Page HTML.

<div id="codeblock3"> </div>

### About section draft

#### First Draft

This project is to create a response to [Lauren Lee McCarthy's](https://lauren-mccarthy.com/I-heard-TALKING-IS-DANGEROUS) project "I heard talking is dangerous". Lauren, through this project, reached out to and engaged with their community of friends during the time of lockdown, covid 19 with the help of technology. Through delivering a monologue, they start a conversion that is held via a text-to-speech functionality to discuss the then controversial topic of masks and social distancing.

Lauren used technology to connect with others in her community to prompt an interesting conversation, the aim of this project is to, in a similar fashion, engage with a chosen community of mine through creative coding.

The chosen community is the creative friends around me. I have asked those around me that I know to be creatively inclined to share a piece of their creative selves with the aim to create one big collaborative portfolio that I can then share back with everyone.

The portfolio is reflective of the creative network that stems from myself and I hope sharing the portfolio back with everyone that they'll find something new and inspiring from the others in my network to help their creative practice. Fostering an interconnected creative network; mycelial creativity.

##### Breaking down 'creative friends' as a community of practice:

**Domain:**
Creative friends, and groups in general, are often constantly exploring new ideas, mediums, cultures and possibilities. Many start within one specific area of creative work but I think many end up expanding; learning new techniques and mediums to improve and develop their own practice. This can often look like finding ways to use things unconventionally (like using a 3d modelling application like blender to create node interactions) or using creative techniques in tandem with other areas to innovate (like creative start ups or marketing).

**Repertoire:**
This community are often big in creative thinking; brainstorming and ideation, storytelling and narrative structure, and a keen eye on minute details and aesthetics. But also hold high technical skill literacy; creative tools (Adobe suite), traditional techniques(sketching, model sculpting (physical and digital), writing and musical instruments), and high digital fluency (social media content). With the cross-disciplinary nature of the creative community and industry, this community is also very collaborative with an open minded-ness to experimentation and failure.

I find that a common lived experience between the creative friends around me often include a Macbook of some sort with an extensive file system that often isn't organised very well, but makes sense to themselves, which is where the inspiration for the interface and aesthetics of this portfolio has come from.

**Values:**
The values that often drive the interactions of the creative community as a whole, and the creative friends I have around me are often held in high authenticity with a constant curiosity to learn from our lived experiences to improve our practice and learn from each other. Interacting with one another theres often a playfulness that sparks the creation of work that resonates emotionally with ourselves and others. I've found that this group also hold a higher regard for sustainability as a whole too, therefore I'd say the creative friends around me are very empathetic.

          of masks and social distancing.
          <br />
          Lauren used technology to connect with others in her community to
          prompt an interesting conversation, the aim of this project is to, in
          a similar fashion, engage with a chosen community of mine through
          creative coding.
          <br />
          The chosen community is the creative friends around me. I have asked
          those around me that I know to be creatively inclined to share a piece
          of their creative selves with the aim to create one big collaborative
          portfolio that I can then share back with everyone.
          <br />
          The portfolio is reflective of the creative network that stems from
          myself and I hope sharing the portfolio back with everyone that
          they'll find something new and inspiring from the others in my network
          to help their creative practice. Fostering an interconnected creative
          network; mycelial creativity.

          Breaking down 'creative friends' as a community of practice:
        </h3>
        <h4>Domain:</h4>
        <p class="abouttxt">
          Creative friends, and groups in general, are often constantly
          exploring new ideas, mediums, cultures and possibilities. Many start
          within one specific area of creative work but I think many end up
          expanding; learning new techniques and mediums to improve and develop
          their own practice. This can often look like finding ways to use
          things unconventionally (like using a 3d modelling application like
          blender to create node interactions) or using creative techniques in
          tandem with other areas to innovate (like creative start ups or
          marketing).
        </p>
        <h4>Repertoire:</h4>
        <p class="abouttxt">
          This community are often big in creative thinking; brainstorming and
          ideation, storytelling and narrative structure, and a keen eye on
          minute details and aesthetics. But also hold high technical skill
          literacy; creative tools (Adobe suite), traditional
          techniques(sketching, model sculpting (physical and digital), writing
          and musical instruments), and high digital fluency (social media
          content). With the cross-disciplinary nature of the creative community
          and industry, this community is also very collaborative with an open
          minded-ness to experimentation and failure.
          <br />
          I find that a common lived experience between the creative friends
          around me often include a Macbook of some sort with an extensive file
          system that often isn't organised very well, but makes sense to
          themselves, which is where the inspiration for the interface and
          aesthetics of this portfolio has come from.
        </p>
        <h4>Values:</h4>
        <p class="abouttxt">
          The values that often drive the interactions of the creative community
          as a whole, and the creative friends I have around me are often held
          in high authenticity with a constant curiosity to learn from our lived
          experiences to improve our practice and learn from each other.
          Interacting with one another theres often a playfulness that sparks
          the creation of work that resonates emotionally with ourselves and
          others. I've found that this group also hold a higher regard for
          sustainability as a whole too, therefore I'd say the creative friends
          around me are very empathetic.
