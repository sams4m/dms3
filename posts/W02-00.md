# Homework

> Please include in your discussion a broad description of your plan for AT1, along with an embedded p5 sketch that helps explain how you will make it work.

I think 'cute' as a register ultimately makes something more palatable, especially with a heavier topic. In making 'cute' visuals, sounds and interactions the Kiki and Bouba effect comes to mind.

From the class activity, I also used DeepSeek to help ideate what characterises cute, which bought up the following that I thought was key to include:

Playfulness and Whimsy:
Cuteness often incorporates playful, whimsical elements, such as sparkles, hearts, stars, or other decorative motifs that evoke joy and lightheartedness.

Soft Textures:
The tactile quality of cute objects often involves softness, such as plush fabrics, fluffy materials, or smooth surfaces that invite touch.

Expressive Emotions:
Cute characters or designs often display exaggerated emotions, like wide-eyed wonder, shyness, or happiness, which make them relatable and endearing.

Small Size:
Cuteness is often associated with smallness or diminutiveness, as smaller things are perceived as more vulnerable and in need of protection (e.g., baby animals, tiny objects).

I think that 'cute' resonates with 'bouba', which I think would manifest physically through 'soft' imagery, like small, rounded, blurred shapes. Making sure shapes aren't overly sharp edged and encourage a welcoming positive energy (regardless of underlying connotations). I think especially with unconventional kindred spirits, having a blurred perception would help soften the appearance and make it more approachable as a concept, making it 'cute'.

Sound wise, I'd imagine 'rounded' sounds that are bouncy and short (though not too short, kind of toeing the line but not overreaching into territory that might make the short sound 'snappy', which instead sounds aggressive), perhaps a little mystical like chimes. What comes to mind are sort of nostalgic tunes: 'game' 'beepy' sounds, popping bubbles, soft whistles and wind chimes. Playing with the idea of ghostly entities, perhaps toeing the line between cute and uncanny by doing an echoing sound may really join the spirit of 'cute' and the spooky kindred spirit.

A cute interaction would perhaps be a mix of simple child-like innocence, nostalgic at core and a little playful. What comes to mind is something more slow paced to embody the simplicity of innocence, maybe embodying the essence of hide and seek? Sort of mimicking the feeling of a nursery rhyme; innocent by the exterior but a bit spooky when you dive down deeper into the meaning behind them. I think that embodies ghostly entities quite well.

Bringing this together, I'm thinking of having a "sparkling background" of blurred 2D shapes (blobs not necessarily circles?) and then having a main shape (maybe 3D to make it contrast the background and create a clear differentiation between the two) that moves based on mouse position.

frameRate() will definitely be utilised to slow down the imagery, approximately around 2-5.
filter(BLUR, 15) to blur the canvas

I attempted to play around with these ideas on p5. For this, I did some research and found a [compiled list of shapes](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/p5-js-shape-complete-reference/) that can be done on p5, which I explored a bit with the 3D shapes. The 3D shapes need WEBGL to also be added in canvas set up.

I quickly realised that the 3D shapes required a transformation to move, playing around with translate(x, y, z) I found that it actually made recurring moving/floating shapes on screen -- would most likely need noLoop() to stop this. But I found it quite fun and entertaining and might change how and what I incorporate in the assignment. At the moment I'm still experimenting.

This 3D torus I expanded to move based off mouse movements. It gives an eery ghostly feeling.

> translate(mouseX/2, mouseY/2). Over 2 to slow down the interaction a bit. Gives it a bit of a delay that drags and makes it seem like its following but at the same time something is off.

Using the random() function to have circles randomly plotted on the screen. This can be further expanded on to plot multiple on the whole page using a nested for loop. Sort of like the grid of squares from the previous week but make it even more hectic because the shapes will not be plotted symmetrically but randomly. And with how the for loop works the shapes will also be printed at different rates so there'll be the chaos of timing being different on top of each shape being randomly plotted on canvas.

Further refining and developing this into:\
I moved this into a new project to try keep the code more clean.
