# Homework

### 1. In teams of 2 or 3, use¬†[flok.cc](https://flok.cc/)¬†to stage a 6-24 minute, collaborative live coding performance that uses:

    - [hydra](https://hydra.ojack.xyz/?sketch_)¬†for visuals
    - [strudel](https://strudel.cc/)¬†for audio
    - press the little ‚åò button in the top right to make a new pane, so you can live code both hydra and strudel at the same time

> Team: Kunzie, Lam and I.

<script type="module">
const iframe = document.getElementById (`w08-00`)
iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>

> Attempt 1.

The first attempt went quite interesting, it was decided that Kunzie and I would pair up to work on the visuals on hydra and lam who is more musically inclined would work on strudel. Kunzie and I didn't actually really know what we were doing, but we did look through other peoples work for inspiration in preparation for this, and just went for it based off what we saw and could remember when the time came. However Lam couldn't get his strudel code to quite work in the first attempt so we had a second attempt.
