# Notes on Assignment 1 before this class

Heading into this class I ended up loosing my previous further progress that I had already done on the 'noise remix' due to the save files going out of sync -- I guess that's just a risk and the nature of working online. Hopefully this wouldn't be an issue later on when we go to work locally for assignment 2. Because of this I feel I am a tad bit more behind than I'd like because I was hoping to get some opinions and feedback from class mates in class. Thankfully it'll be easy for me to re-write the code again after class since I've already re-written it so many times at this point, and I was thinking to scrap this idea either way. I feel its a bit too chaotic and busy to fit within the cute aesthetic register which follows a more simple build. While using the pixelated background is quite mesmerising to look at in itself, I can't really do any more work on it, as then it gets too complicated. I think taking a step back and simplifying the background will allow for me to add a sprite whilst working within the boundaries of the 'cute' aesthetic register.

> The revived test code that I was working on leading into this class. I had closed all the p5 open tabs I had on Safari and restarted my laptop before the p5 window was able to get back on the correct sync file. I think there also may be some browser compatibility issues; p5 doesn't work well with Safari.

From here, I refashioned the assignment after class, completely scrapping what I originally had and started from a brand new p5 file. I went back to the idea of a more plain background paired with using blurred shapes. I also went back to look at RafaÃ«l Rozendaal's work, which was when I got the idea of creating a sketch with blooming circles, kind of like blooming flowers. I feel the blooming circles best visually reflect the feeling of intrigue that I get when interacting with the topic of ghosts and paranormal entities. It also emulates the ghostly floating feeling that I imagine ghosts to behave like. On top of that, I'm thinking to incorporate a little star as a sprite that will semi-follow the mouse, but also float around on the page. Disappearing for a bit half way through but then also returning, like what I imagine a ghost would behave like.

# Homework

### 1. Please describe how your AT1 will use each of the following concepts:

> - variables
> - functions
> - iteration
> - boolean logic
> - arrays
> - classes

#### Variables:

Overall, variables will hold different parameters assigned at the start of the code or further down. Either in the form of single constant numbers, or arrays and/or objects that hold multiple values. Global variables in particular will be variables that can be accessed throughout the code, whereas local variables will only be accessible within the specific scope.

#### Functions:

Functions will hold actions that will be executed when called upon, this can range from simpler ones such as play a sound when screen is clicked or more difficult maths calculations, or actions such as draw a shape. (E.g. To follow through with the star idea, I would need to have a function to draw the star shape, as there isn't any inbuilt star shape like there are for circles and squares).
Another use that functions will have is to keep the code clean. By delegating actions into the functions, it can keep the draw function short and clean. This would also making reading and debugging the code a lot easier (especially when paired with intuitive naming and adequate comments).

#### Iteration:

Iterations such as for loops will help simplify and shorten the code whilst executing something that would otherwise take up a complicated and unnecessary amount of lines of code. By using iterative loops in the code it would shorten and clean up the code, which would also help with readability and prevent unnecessary mistakes in the code.

#### Boolean logic

Boolean logic which uses binary values (true or false) will help with controlling the flow of conditional statements like if and else / control which code blocks to execute and when. E.g. if something === true then the following will then occur. It would be handy in creating interactions such as mouse clicked.

#### Arrays

Arrays hold multiple parameters within the one variable. This will help minimise the amount of variables needed to be used in the code when there are variables that fall within the same nature, such as colours. Instead of having multiple variables named colour1, colour2, colour3, etc, it can all be stored in one colours array looking like colours [ length of array => number of colours in total - 1 ]. This will also help with keeping the code clean and short, improving the readability of the code. Objects can also be held in arrays, which further emphasises the point of keeping variable names to a minimum, keeping the code short, clean and easy to read.

#### Classes

Classes create a blueprint of objects, holding data (attributes) and behaviours (methods) that relate to one specific instance. This helps with organising (keeping clean) and reusability of the code. In this case, I'll be using it to define the structure and behaviour of the background blooming circles, which will reset and over-write, thus redraw an instance every time the screen is interacted with. The class itself will also be kept in it's own js file, which will help keep the code organised and short. Which will make it easier for me to read and debug when there are issues.

### 2. Embed a rough draft of your AT1 on your blog. Discuss:

After scrapping the last project I was able to fairly successfully implement what I had envisioned above. The background colour gets drawn during set up, meaning it'll only get drawn that one time, anything drawn on top after would cover it, becoming the next 'background' for anything that gets drawn on top of that. This idea is inspired from what I was able to learn from the first artwork that I chose to look at by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal (Reflections). This way, it becomes a never ending cycle of blooming circles, especially when the screen gets clicked and the colours also continuously change; it'll become a gradient of colours. This background was also written to be in it's own class, with the blur filter was added in the class so that it only affects the background, and the sprite will not be affected and blurred.

The colours were also chosen meticulously to highlight the cute aesthetic. Analogous colours made of 2 pinks, a purple and 3 blues were chosen. Ghosts/spirits are often depicted with a translucent or pale appearance in media, therefore associated with colours like blue and grey which are "shadow"colours. I didn't think grey is a very 'cute' colour though, which is why I replaced it with purple instead. However another issue is that purple and blue together aren't very balanced, which is why I bought in the colour pink, both a very cute colour and right beside purple on the colour wheel. Which would balance out the purple and blue and get them to work together harmoniously. Grouping the purple together with the pink, I've grouped colours in to lots. Each 'lot' is made up of 3 shades each, a light, medium and dark shade. The pink lot is made up of a dark purple-pink, and two lighter shades of pink make up the light and medium, while for the blue lot theres 3 different shades of blue. All the colours are stored in an array, which I've put in a seperate js file to keep the main code clean and for it to be easier to edit the colours if needed.

> The colours:
> 00: light pink feb6c1
> 01: pink ce7c8f
> 02: dark pink/purple 5b3244
> 03: light blue 79c6d6
> 04: blue 275e8d
> 05: dark blue 1d1b2e

For the ghost sprite, I've decided to draw a star to represent, and to keep the colours coordinated and harmonious, I decided to go with a yellow. Following a triadic colour combination. For now I have decided to go with the inbuilt colour 'cornsilk' which is a pastel yellow, however this may change later, I have yet to decide.

As the p5 library doesn't have a built in star shape, I've had to use drawShape() to draw a custom shape. I've deduced that the star function will take in 5 values; x coordinate, y coordinate, inner radius, outer radius and number of points. On top of all that, I added rotation to the shape so that it would also move on its own, orbiting around the x and y coordinate. This way the sprite will seemingly wander off on it's own and float away and disappear, making it similar to a game of hide and seek. Mimicking the movements and playful nature of ghosts (or the playful nature that they can have).

> The notes I made to help figure out the maths and code:

> <img src="/W03/00.jpg" alt="00.jpg"/>

```
function star(x, y, r1, r2, n) {
  // full circle = 2pi
  // angle between each arm of star (points)
  let angle = TWO_PI / n;
  // angles where arms meet
  let halfAngle = angle / 2.0;

  // start drawing star
  beginShape();
  // loops until a full circle complete
  for (let i = 0; i < TWO_PI; i += angle) {
    // drawing points of star
    // x = cosine, y = sin
    let sx = x + cos(i) * r2;
    let sy = y + sin(i) * r2;
    vertex(sx, sy);
    // coming back to where arms of star meet
    sx = x + cos(i + halfAngle) * r1;
    sy = y + sin(i + halfAngle) * r1;
    vertex(sx, sy);
  }
  //end drawing shape
  endShape(CLOSE);
}
```

The sounds I used are from a previous assignment from another class that I felt suit the theme, but am a tad unsure of though. For now I have it set to randomly play one of three earcons when the screen is clicked.

#### The final draft:

**How well did you achieve cuteness in the visual, sonic, and interactive domains?**

I think I have been able to successfully create something cute in aesthetics, interaction and sound after the couple of aborted trials. The gradient blur that creates the blooming imagery creates a soft and whimsy visual paired with chosen colours both cute and ghostly and a small sprite visually reflects the features previously bought up on defining what a 'cute' aesthetic register is. Whilst also capturing the feeling/energy of my kindred spirit. The click interaction is also very simple, paired with the ethereal tone of the earcons, makes it fall within the cute aesthetic register.

**What communities and learning resources did you draw on to do the bulk of your learning for this project?**

Idea wise, looking at other artists work for inspiration really helped with conceptualisation for this project. Coding wise I looked for help online when needed; Stack Overflow for code logistics in general, MDN, w3schools and p5 references for syntax and javascript interactions on youtube and codePen. I found that most my hurdles were figuring out syntax and also realising the potential of interactions with javascript as most my previous experience with coding were very mathematics centred.

**What aspects have you enjoyed the most about this process?Â  What have you found to be most surprising?**

I found creating interactions and experimenting with manipulating shapes and pixels on a screen and seeing the possibilities in output extremely fun in this process. It really made me enjoy the process of coding a lot more than it has in the past.

**What aspects have you struggled with the most?Â  What have you found the most confusing?**

I found the syntax being the most I struggled with, not that it was overly difficult or really a negative thing -- I feel like struggle is a bit too negative to describe the feeling -- but it was different to what I am used to (I had been using C and C#, specifically in Matlab, the most in the past). So it was the biggest hurdle that I had in the coding department. Creatively, I think the most difficult part was actually sticking to cute aesthetic register. I feel that with the kindred spirit that I had chosen, I had a tendency to migrate more to a chaotic/uncanny aesthetic register at times when I was trying to think of ideas, which was obviously a concern since the assignment specifies to create something cute.

# Final adjustments and notes on Assignment 1

After going through, tidying up, and referring to the assignment 1 rubric, I found that I had forgotten about including a boolean variable in my code. I quickly rectified this by changing the click interaction code. I'd originally used an event listener on the canvas (canvas.addEventListener(click, screenClicked);) to activate the canvas clicked interaction. Instead, I've now used an if conditional to state if mouseIsPressed === true it'll activate the function that I had written before (screenClicked).

I also realised in testing that I kept getting an error message at random times stating that the colour index was undefined/null. To debug this I printed out multiple values of where the index changes/gets passed through to pin point at what point it was becoming null and what was causing it to become null.

<img src="/W03/01.jpeg" alt="01.jpeg"/>

After multiple rounds of printing out values and testing it, I was able to find that it was getting lost in the recursion of the colour index randomiser function, where it spits out a random index number, but if the new one is the same as the previous it will recall itself. I forgot to include "return" before recalling itself, which caused the value to get lost and not actually return an index number back to assign to randCol, which is the variable that holds the random colour index. After that was adjusted and multiple tests the code works well without any error messages pertaining the issue anymore.

> The code works now!

After class in Week 4 (first class) I also found out that using work for previous assignments is self plagiarism, so I've gone back and went through the library of freesound.org to find a suitable sound effect for the sketch. Referring back to my original thought of using wind chime sounds, I found a few that I thought may work. So I imported them into Reaper to experiment with.

<img src="/W03/03.jpeg" alt="03.jpeg"/>

> Experimenting with different plugins.

The final version that I settled with primarily has the volume adjusted so that it gets softer, sounding like an echo in the distance. I also lowered the volume of the sound in general so that its softer, giving it a faraway whimsical feeling. Furthermore, it dismisses the need from having to readjust the volume via code.

After further fine tuning, the final sketch for Assignment 1 is as below:
