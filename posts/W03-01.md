# Notes on Assignment 1 before this class

Heading into this class I ended up loosing my previous further progress that I had already done on the 'noise remix' due to the save files going out of sync -- I guess that's just a risk and the nature of working online. Hopefully this wouldn't be an issue later on when we go to work locally for assignment 2. Because of this I feel I am a tad bit more behind than I'd like because I was hoping to get some opinions and feedback from class mates in class. Thankfully it'll be easy for me to re-write the code again after class since I've already re-written it so many times at this point, and I was thinking to scrap this idea either way. I feel its a bit too chaotic and busy to fit within the cute aesthetic register which follows a more simple build. While using the pixelated background is quite mesmerising to look at in itself, I can't really do any more work on it, as then it gets too complicated. I think taking a step back and simplifying the background will allow for me to add a sprite whilst working within the boundaries of the 'cute' aesthetic register.

const iframe = document.getElementById (`w0301-00`)
iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

> The revived test code that I was working on leading into this class. I had closed all the p5 open tabs I had on Safari and restarted my laptop before the p5 window was able to get back on the correct sync file. I think there also may be some browser compatibility issues; p5 doesn't work well with Safari.

From here, I refashioned the assignment after class, completely scrapping what I originally had and started from a brand new p5 file. I went back to the idea of a more plain background paired with using blurred shapes. I also went back to look at RafaÃ«l Rozendaal's work, which was when I got the idea of creating a sketch with blooming circles, kind of like blooming flowers. I feel the blooming circles best visually reflect the feeling of intrigue that I get when interacting with the topic of ghosts and paranormal entities. It also emulates the ghostly floating feeling that I imagine ghosts to behave like. On top of that, I'm thinking to incorporate a little star as a sprite that will semi-follow the mouse, but also float around on the page. Disappearing for a bit half way through but then also returning, like what I imagine a ghost would behave like.

# Homework

### 1. Please describe how your AT1 will use each of the following concepts:

> - variables
> - functions
> - iteration
> - boolean logic
> - arrays
> - classes

#### Variables:

Overall, variables will hold different parameters, either in the form of single constant numbers, or arrays and/or objects that hold multiple values. Global variables in particular will be variables that can be accessed throughout the code, whereas local variables will only be accessible within the specific scope.

### 2. Embed a rough draft of your AT1 on your blog. Discuss:

> - how well did you achieve cuteness in the visual, sonic, and interactive domains?
> - what communities and learning resources did you draw on to do the bulk of your learning for this project?
> - what aspects have you enjoyed the most about this process? What have you found to be most surprising?
> - what aspects have you struggled with the most? What have you found the most confusing?
