# Notes on Assignment 1 before this class

Heading into this class I ended up loosing my previous further progress that I had already done on the 'noise remix' due to the save files going out of sync -- I guess that's just a risk and the nature of working online. Hopefully this wouldn't be an issue later on when we go to work locally for assignment 2. Because of this I feel I am a tad bit more behind than I'd like because I was hoping to get some opinions and feedback from class mates in class. Thankfully it'll be easy for me to re-write the code again after class since I've already re-written it so many times at this point, and I was thinking to scrap this idea either way. I feel its a bit too chaotic and busy to fit within the cute aesthetic register which follows a more simple build. While using the pixelated background is quite mesmerising to look at in itself, I can't really do any more work on it, as then it gets too complicated. I think taking a step back and simplifying the background will allow for me to add a sprite whilst working within the boundaries of the 'cute' aesthetic register.

const iframe = document.getElementById (`w0301-00`)
iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>

> The revived test code that I was working on leading into this class. I had closed all the p5 open tabs I had on Safari and restarted my laptop before the p5 window was able to get back on the correct sync file. I think there also may be some browser compatibility issues; p5 doesn't work well with Safari.
