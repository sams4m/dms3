# Homework

### 1. choose a graphical programming language (GPL) you are interested in out of:

> - Pure Data
> - Max MSP
> - TouchDesigner
> - Unity Visual Scripting
> - Blender Geometry Nodes
> - ComfyUI
> - other

### 2. Find a tutorial series on this GPL, and follow along until you understand the basics.

### 3. Create a patch that demonstrates what you have learned.

### 4. Document the process in a blog post discussing:

> - why you are interested in this GPL
> - how you might use this GPL in your own creative practice
> - the strengths & weaknesses of this GPL vs other GPLs
> - the strengths & weaknesses of GPLs in general, vs text based scripting languages

> Chosen GPL: Touch Designer

I wanted to learn this as I potentially may use it for this assignment, but even before this assignment I had seen a lot of other people's work and thought how cool their work was and how versatile it was to create work that links a lot of different inputs! Even if it wasn't for this course I was already planning to learn it in my own time once the semester was out.

When I first looked up tutorials for touch designer I came across this one by this one by [PJ Visuals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dz8VmLOT_tM&themeRefresh=1) and what specifically drew me in was the thumbnail that looked like a graphic poster that would usually be made in photoshop. It made me intrigued and I thought I'd be able to create the same / similar thing in a software not typically related to graphic design, but after watching the video I realised it was just going through all the basics of how touch designer works, the interface, the different nodes that can be added/used and possibilities. Which, was nice to know as I got to understand touch designer more, but ultimately disappointing because I thought I was going to achieve a really cool poster after the tutorial. üíî

Taking the idea of "creating graphic design in a non-graphic design software" I then proceeded to look up how to create a heat map effect in touch designer. I found [Xtal's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvSpe4YiZDs) which I found both really informative in the walk through and easy to follow.

Starting with **_movie file in_** to import the video (essentially the input, could also use your camera) before adding **_luma level_** to adjust the image colour and levels (adjust the brightness of the video and make the image look contrasted like a heat map).

<img src="/W09/01.jpeg" alt="01.jpeg" style="width:100%"/>

To further create the base for the heat map visual a feedback loop with blur and level was added. The dynamic feedback loop will help help enhance the thermal effect; blur will soften the image for a smooth heat distortion look and level will help adjust the overall contrast and brightness after blur is applied.

Adding the **_composite_** node between level and luma level and dragging and dropping it into the feedback node's target input will create the dynamic loop will integrate the processed image into the feedback loop, and effect the final thermal effect visuals. From here the previous nodes (luma level, blur and level) were fine tuned to get a smoother and more realistic heat map look.

Changing the comp operation from the default multiply to over will also blend the image from the feedback over the original video to create a layered effect that further refines the visual to look more realistic as it makes smaller details to be more visible.

Next a **_look up_** node with a **_ramp_** node attached was added which allows for colour to be mapped onto the video visuals. Specifically the look up node will allow us to map the brightness values and the ramp defines the colour gradient for the thermal vision. This is where the typical RYGB thermal map colours can be mapped on, but I adjusted it to be red -> yellow --> white -> pink -> green.

Now that the thermal effect base is done, the tutorial then goes on to show how to add noise to create the paper grunge effect commonly used in graphic design.

A **_null_** node was added before adding **_noise_** to create the grain texture.

<img src="/W09/04.jpeg" alt="04.jpeg" style="width:100%"/>

A **_level_** node was added to the noise to adjust the contrast and intensity of the noise pattern; to make it more subtle or intense and stylised. And **_blur_** was added on top to soften the grain.

**_Displace_** is added after blur, and noise is also connected to the input to integrate the texture style smoother and make the displacement more stylised.

Another **_composite_** node is added after and connected to noise, with the operation overlay to combine the different layers of affects. Overlay blends the images and enhances the bright areas and leaves the dark areas intact too, which lets the texture blend in naturally and dynamically to the moving heat map imagery underneath, and really bring out the paper grain texture.

<img src="/W09/05.jpeg" alt="05.jpeg" style="width:100%"/>

To finish off and export, a **_null_**, then **_out_** and **_movie file out_** nodes were added.
