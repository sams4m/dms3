# Homework

### 1. choose a graphical programming language (GPL) you are interested in out of:

> - Pure Data
> - Max MSP
> - TouchDesigner
> - Unity Visual Scripting
> - Blender Geometry Nodes
> - ComfyUI
> - other

### 2. Find a tutorial series on this GPL, and follow along until you understand the basics.

### 3. Create a patch that demonstrates what you have learned.

### 4. Document the process in a blog post discussing:

> - why you are interested in this GPL
> - how you might use this GPL in your own creative practice
> - the strengths & weaknesses of this GPL vs other GPLs
> - the strengths & weaknesses of GPLs in general, vs text based scripting languages

> Chosen GPL: Touch Designer
> I wanted to learn this as I potentially may use it for this assignment, but even before this assignment I had seen a lot of other people's work and thought how cool their work was and how versatile it was to create work that links a lot of different inputs! Even if it wasn't for this course I was already planning to learn it in my own time once the semester was out.
