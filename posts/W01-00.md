# Homework

### 1. [This sketch](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/-B11g3Uth)Â uses aÂ [for loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)Â to create a line of squares.Â  What might be an efficient way to use for loops (multiple) to create a grid?

> - document your attempts and investigations, along with any resources or communities you engage

My immediate thought to efficiently create a grid of squares would be to use a nested for loop, creating an 'array' of squares.
You'd either want to set pre-determined number of columns and rows, or, a predetermined square size. (const var)
For the former, there would be 2 extra variables; column size and row size. This would be calculated using the canvas width and height.
For the latter, you'd also want 2 extra variables; columns and rows. This would be calculated in the same way as the former.
These would be in the set up

In the draw function is where the nested for loop would be. The first would be for columns, and the nested one would go through the rows. It would essentially go through and map out x amount of rows by column.

for ( i = 0; i < col; i ++);
i == counter
i < col == the limit, counter starts at 0, therefore less than

The initial attempt rendered this. I grabbed the base code from the provided link and rewrote the nested for loops and variables along with that. I realised the squares started from the origin, which made it look like the grid was off centre. I quickly realised the issue being the X and Y coordinate for the first iteration of the loops would be 0 since the counter starts at zero, which was what was causing the grid to 'misalign'.

Instead, changing the parameter to (i + 0.5) \* colSize added half a column size onto the coordinates, allowing the grid to be centred.
\*\* during execution, I went with predetermining the number of columns and rows as I felt this was more flexible in user application than the other.

I then also changed some numbers around to check that the code does work and theres no other blind spots that I may have missed, whilst cleaning up and adding comments to the code.

Some other thoughts I have from this exercise:
Considerations to make the constraints more flexible for a user application:
Row and column length could be asked as a user input instead
To make this more flexible, you could use rect instead of square, this allows the user to create grids with different lengths and heights.

### 2. Choose a work by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal fromÂ [here](https://www.newrafael.com/websites/).

> - use words, pictures, and diagrams to explain how you think Rozendaal's code works under the hood.
> - make a list of concepts you would need to learn in order to replicate the work in p5.js
> - make a list of resources that might help you learn those concepts

#### Initial thoughts:

When ignoring the colours at first, its basically two circles, one after the other. Factoring the movement simulated from the colours it would be like multiple circles layered exactly on top of each other continuously growing at different paces, each layer a different colour that creates the gradient.
Theres really only 3 colours each time the colour scheme changes; the background (static, in this case the pink), and 2 'circle' colours that change in size to produce that growing movement (in this case the cyan and orange).

The gradient can be produced by tapered/blurred edge, this could perhaps be created through lowered opacity around the edges if there isn't a built in gradient function/feature. Or, can be with multiple circles layered that kind of manually blends everything together.

The changing size could be done with a for loop with a var incrementing the 'size' variable in an eclipse, reseting once it fills the screen to create the 'respawning' effect.

Layers may be done by specifying a z index; when the circle 'respawns' the z index updates by +2 every time, with one starting with an index of 1, the second circle 2.

Resources to help understand and make this possible:

- p5 resource library
- Youtube
- Google
- StackOverflow
- w3schools.com
- mdn

#### Thoughts after some research:

After some research on how to create a gradient circle on the web, I came across an example on p5 for ['For loops for gradient circles'](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://editor.p5js.org/jordanBlueshift/sketches/HkrijmhPM&ved=2ahUKEwj4mNCyn_2LAxUNsVYBHfbFMKgQFnoECCUQAQ&usg=AOvVaw0nyKkPtnFMEvZwp-zpBLHi) . I played around with the numbers in the code to better understand what was happening and I was able to deduce that a blurred circle could be created using fill, noStroke and adjusting the alpha level in fill.

Also changing my thoughts on how the chosen work works. Rather than a set scheme of 3, I think the background occurs once, at the start of the code. Therefore it would be in the set up function so that it gets 'overwritten' and doesn't get redrawn every time (so it wouldn't affect the colours of the circle). Still 2 circles, the y coordinate for one located at the top of the page (0) and the second the bottom of the page (height). No adjustments made so that half of the circle(s) get cut off, creating the illusion of a reflection.
There are constantly new circles spawning when the previous reaches half the window height, where the big circle becomes the new background.
