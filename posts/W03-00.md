# Homework

### 1. Revisit the work ofÂ [Rafael Rozendaal](http://visually%20sonically%20interactively).Â  Choose one piece, and describe how he achieves a cute aesthetic register:

> - visually
> - sonically
> - interactively

<img src="/W03/00.gif" alt="Push"/>

> Chosen work: push

Visually it reminds me a bit of Yayoi Kusama's work due to the dots, but not as overwhelming. The combination of a minimal use of dots lined up and movement makes it seem like a snake. The movement brings some nostalgic energy (personally) and reminds me of the board game snakes and ladders. This makes it rather cute. The colour pallet is also very bright but harmonic, a mix of pastels and brighter colours also reminds me of children's clothing, elevating the sense of nostalgia. It uses a simple click/mouse down interaction. The simplicity makes it not only easy but sort of like a 'fidget' where I just kept clicking the screen and the colours and 'snake' pattern changes.

I'm not quite sure if there's meant to be sound or not, but I can't hear anything from my webpage so I can't comment on how he achieves the cute aesthetic register sonically.

### 2. With regard to your AT1, and using embedded p5 sketches, explain how you plan on achieving the aesthetic register of cute:

> - visually
> - sonically
> - interactively

I feel that theres a lot of potential to create something really abstract in interpretation with this theme, as aesthetics is also something very subjective. Therefore I've done a lot of experimenting and brainstorming, taking inspiration from how paranormal activity is portrayed in media in attempt to create something a bit more abstract. For this assignment, I'm thinking to create something that reflects the feeling that I receive from the kindred spirit and in turn, try to materialise/channel their energy through the p5 sketch.

Following on from last week's explorations I decided against using 3d elements. It seemed to significantly slow down my web browser with how heavy the load is with just two elements (even when I lower the number of segments in both x and y dimension that the shapes are made of). This may just be an issue with how many things are running on my laptop and slowing it down, but the fact that it's already flagging as a potential issue I think it may be for the best to abort now and keep it more simple -- it'll be more on brand for the "cute" aesthetic register this way anyway.

From there, I started with coming up with ideas to create different backgrounds.

<iframe id="at1-test" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sams4m/full/vvagHvo2q"></iframe>

> TV static

<script type="module">
const iframe = document.getElementById (`at1-test`)
iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>

I started with this TV static sort of idea, visually like those ghost hunter radio tools that often is a bunch of static. Where the code was inspired by one of Coding Train - Daniel Shiffman's tutorials on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMUMZ5YRxHI) where it uses for loops to randomise the rgb colour values for each pixel before updating them each frame.

<iframe id="at1-test1" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sams4m/full/fs7Xs0HV_"></iframe>

> Test project developed from TV static

<script type="module">
const iframe = document.getElementById (`at1-test1`)
iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>

Which then developed into this test project where the random() limits were changed in the loops for the rgb values to give the screen a more pinkish hue so that it would visually fall more within the 'cute' aesthetic registry. I also experimented further, and added some circles that pop up on screen, a placeholder sprite emulating the energy of a ghost. Placeholder, because I'm currently not 100% sure what I'll be using as a sprite -- whether I'm going to import an image or draw a shape -- but rather, focusing more on the logistics side of the assignment first. But I do know that I would like to use a sprite to create some cute interactions, like the hide and seek idea previously mentioned. However I'm still not too sure what to use for audio, I'm thinking I may use one of the sound design earcons I made last year since it falls within a cute ethereal aesthetic which I feel reflects the feeling (that I get) from a ghost the most.

Even after adjusting the background to be 'cute' colour wise and attempting to slow down the frame rate, I still didn't feel that the static background was quite within the cute register -- it was a bit too chaotic to be 'cute' so I tried to iterate on this idea, and I made a sort of star-y sparkly iteration of the background.

<iframe id="at1-test2" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sams4m/full/9OUNN9Zwc"></iframe>

> Stary sky test project

<script type="module">
const iframe = document.getElementById (`at1-test2`)
iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>

Even after playing around with this idea, where I changed the colours, slowed down the frame rate, changed parameters (e.g. how many 'stars', how big of a size range of stars there are) etc, I felt a bit like I've reached a dead end here. There's too much chaotic energy for it to fall within the 'cute' aesthetic register so I think I may retire this idea since I feel that I've already given it a good shot and theres no point on being so hung up on this idea if it isn't going to work.

Moving on, as I was going through the content that I missed from last Thursday's class since I was sick, I found the 'noise' sketch from the 'Useful Concept' sketches to be really cute, and proceeded to remix it.

<iframe id="at1-test3" src="https://editor.p5js.org/sams4m/full/wn4Ua6RcQ"></iframe>

> Noise remix

<script type="module">
const iframe = document.getElementById (`at1-test3`)
iframe.width = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42
</script>

I changed the colours to be more 'cute' and am thinking to add a ghostly sprite that blends in and out from the background and changes in size.

### 3. Enlist some feedback on your ideas from a colleague.Â  Ask them, for each of your examples above:

> - how well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?
> - what could you try to increase the cuteness?
> - how might you use implement these improvements using javascript?

I asked the opinions from some people outside of class so that it would be a more fresh set of eyes looking at the work who also don't have any background context. The unanimous feedback that I received was that the colour was really cute, and I quote, "really Sam". As I hadn't had a chance yet to properly implement the ideas above (still a work in progress) I could only conceptually explain the planned next steps for this round of experimenting, which overall received positive feedback. I got suggestions to import a cute little ghost artwork as the sprite to help boost the cuteness, and overall, slow smooth movements to help increase both the ghostly attributes and cuteness.
