# Homework

### 1. Revisit the work of [Rafael Rozendaal](http://visually%20sonically%20interactively).  Choose one piece, and describe how he achieves a cute aesthetic register:

    - visually
    - sonically
    - interactively

> Chosen work: push

Visually it reminds me a bit of Yayoi Kusama's work due to the dots, but not as overwhelming. The combination of a minimal use of dots lined up and movement makes it seem like a snake. The movement brings some nostalgic energy (personally) and reminds me of the board game snakes and ladders. This makes it rather cute. The colour pallet is also very bright but harmonic, a mix of pastels and brighter colours also reminds me of children's clothing, elevating the sense of nostalgia. It uses a simple click/mouse down interaction. The simplicity makes it not only easy but sort of like a 'fidget' where I just kept clicking the screen and the colours and 'snake' pattern changes.

I'm not quite sure if there's meant to be sound or not, but I can't hear anything from my webpage so I can't comment on how he achieves the cute aesthetic register sonically.

### 2. With regard to your AT1, and using embedded p5 sketches, explain how you plan on achieving the aesthetic register of cute:

    - visually
    - sonically
    - interactively

### 3. Enlist some feedback on your ideas from a colleague.  Ask them, for each of your examples above:

    - how well did you achieve a cute aesthetic?
    - what could you try to increase the cuteness?
    - how might you use implement these improvements using javascript?
