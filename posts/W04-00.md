# Homework

### 1. Please use either Canvas API or the p5 online editor to create three example compositions, demonstrating:

> 1. high compressibility
> 2. low compressibility
> 3. high effective complexity
>
> - try [The Coding Train's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bxNsa_3SfCPyF9Md9XvXhR)Â orÂ [Nature of Code](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6ZV4yEcW3uDwOgGXKUUsPOM)Â playlists for inspiration

We had discussed the 3 different venues in class and what I've gathered/deduced from this was:

- As random-ness goes up, the aesthetic gets more chaotic
- Aesthetic register and effective complexity : effective complexity affects the aesthetic register
- High compressability - > very ordered, like a grid that can be 'compressed', theres a pattern
- Low compressibility -> little order, no pattern, no way to express it in a simpler way -> something very random
- High effective complexity -> a mix of both alot of structure/order and randomness

From understanding this, I created 3 compositions, one for each:

<!-- HIGH COMPRESS ------------------------------------------------------------->
<iframe id="w04-00-1" src="https://sams4m.github.io/comm2747-cr-coding/w04-00/high-compress/"></iframe>

> High compressability
> My thought was to create something that can be easily "crushed" down or simplified, like a grid, kind of like the grid from week 1. But I wanted to make something a bit more interesting compared to week 1 though, so I changed it to stars.

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`w04-00-1`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

<!-- LOW COMPRESS ------------------------------------------------------------->
<iframe id="w04-00-2" src="https://sams4m.github.io/comm2747-cr-coding/w04-00/low-compress/"></iframe>

> Low compressability
> My thought was to create somethign a bit more chaotic and you can't actually simplify. From the reading, I had also gathered that a low to not compressible work would be something truly randomised; maximally disordered with no underlying structure. No pattern and redundancy to take advantage of. With that in mind, I ended up using this as a chance to experiment and get used to the syntax for coding in javascript via VScode, and ditching p5.

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`w04-00-2`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>

<!-- HIGH EFFECTIVE COMPRESS ------------------------------------------------------------->
<iframe id="w04-00-3" src="https://sams4m.github.io/comm2747-cr-coding/w04-00/effective-complexity/"></iframe>

> High effective complexity

<script type="module">

    const iframe  = document.getElementById (`w04-00-3`)
    iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth
    iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42

</script>
