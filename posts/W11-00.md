# Homework

### 1. work out how to do screen recording on your computer.

### 2. record a few minutes of yourself:

> - researching your AT3 community of practice
> - working on your code
> - using online resources to help you with your project

### 3. use some video editing software to modulate the playback speed your screen recordings

> - speed up the boring bits
> - slow down when there is something important or interesting being shown

### 4. write down your plan for AT3.¬† Include:

> - the domain, repertoire, and values of the community you have chosen
> - an explanation of the code you are planning to use
> - a practical description of what your plan is / how you see it working

### 5. rewrite the text you wrote in task 4 as a haiku (or similarly short form)

> - you may need to iterate with different angles / emphases until you find the version you like
> - you can use AI assistance for this task

### 6. use the text from task 5 as a voice-over for your speed-modulated screen recording.¬†¬†

> - set it to some (copyright free) music
> - post it on youtube (or wherever)
> - embed it in a blog post
> - along with some discussion
