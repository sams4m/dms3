# Homework

### 1. work out how to do screen recording on your computer.

### 2. record a few minutes of yourself:

> - researching your AT3 community of practice
> - working on your code
> - using online resources to help you with your project

### 3. use some video editing software to modulate the playback speed your screen recordings

> - speed up the boring bits
> - slow down when there is something important or interesting being shown

### 4. write down your plan for AT3.¬† Include:

> - the domain, repertoire, and values of the community you have chosen
> - an explanation of the code you are planning to use
> - a practical description of what your plan is / how you see it working

> Community chosen: Creative Friends

#### Domain:

Creative friends, and groups in general, are often constantly exploring new ideas, mediums, cultures and possibilities. Many start within one specific area of creative work but I think many end up expanding; learning new techniques and mediums to improve and develop their own practice. This can often look like finding ways to use things unconventionally (like using a 3d modelling application like blender to create node interactions) or using creative techniques in tandem with other areas to innovate (like creative start ups or marketing).

#### Repertoire:

This community are often big in creative thinking; brainstorming and ideation, storytelling and narrative structure, and a keen eye on minute details and aesthetics. But also hold high technical skill literacy; creative tools (Adobe suite), traditional techniques(sketching, model sculpting (physical and digital), writing and musical instruments), and high digital fluency (social media content). With the cross-disciplinary nature of the creative community and industry, this community is also very collaborative with an open minded-ness to experimentation and failure.  
I find that a common lived experience between the creative friends around me often include a Macbook of some sort with an extensive file system that often isn't organised very well, but makes sense to themselves, which is where the inspiration for the interface and aesthetics of this portfolio has come from.

#### Values:

The values that often drive the interactions of the creative community as a whole, and the creative friends I have around me are often held in high authenticity with a constant curiosity to learn from our lived experiences to improve our practice and learn from each other. Interacting with one another theres often a playfulness that sparks the creation of work that resonates emotionally with ourselves and others. I've found that this group also hold a higher regard for sustainability as a whole too, therefore I'd say the creative friends around me are very empathetic.

#### Explanation of code:

The framework of the code is pretty simple and straight forward. HTML, CSS and Javascript is used to code the portfolio website, which will be hosted on Github Pages. HTML will handle to content of the pages, which links to the CSS style sheets and scripts. CSS will primarily handle the styling, but also some basic interaction effects and animations like hover effects, the growing gradient background animation and state changes. Javascript will handle the connecting star spores in the background of the landing page, and also other more complicated interactions, such as the folder dragging interactions and click events.

#### Plan:

In response to Lauren Lee McCarthy's¬†project "I heard talking is dangerous", the aim of this project is to, in a similar fashion, engage with and bring together my community of creative friends through creative coding.  
I intend to ask those around me that I know to be creatively inclined to share a piece of their creative selves with the aim to create one big collective portfolio that I can then share back with everyone.  
The portfolio aims to be a reflective of the creative network that stems from myself and I hope sharing the portfolio back with everyone that they'll find something new and inspiring from the others in my network to help their creative practice. Fostering an interconnected creative network; mycelial creativity.

### 5. rewrite the text you wrote in task 4 as a haiku (or similarly short form)

> - you may need to iterate with different angles / emphases until you find the version you like
> - you can use AI assistance for this task

I'm not great at writing haikus (or poems in general) and in the effort of trying to be more open with using AI, I asked a few LLMs to help write a haiku based of the text from task 4 and took inspiration from the ones I liked to create the haiku.

New mediums bloom‚Äî  
star spores link our messy screens‚Äî  
playful, boundless minds.

-- DeepSeek

Macs hum, thoughts collide ‚Äî  
playful spores of art connect,  
roots of shared wonder.

-- Chat GPT

New ideas bloom,
Playful minds, connected, grow,
Art's rich network thrives.

-- Gemini

The final haiku created:
Macs hum, thoughts collide
Star spores connect our minds
Art's rich network thrives

### 6. use the text from task 5 as a voice-over for your speed-modulated screen recording.¬†¬†

> - set it to some (copyright free) music
> - post it on youtube (or wherever)
> - embed it in a blog post
> - along with some discussion

# Assignment 3

Over this weekend I've made the most progress in terms of the code for this assignment, and in general getting the "product" part of this assignment together.

I had gotten a google form together to collect the work from my creative friends -- I found that this would be the most efficient and organised way on both ends to get it done. All the responses will be in one place and I wont have to keep track of and search through private conversations to hunt down the information and artwork.

The form is very short and essentially asks for name (so I can identify who it is), a nickname if thats what they'd prefer their work be labelled under, a favourite emoji (taking after the modern apple aesthetic) , a little bio and a link to their work.

[Form Link](https://forms.gle/pCTyZuhArY7CfRYk7)

Aesthetically, I wanted to draw from the mac os and filing system aesthetic. Design students sort of have a repertoire of a semi messy filing system with the many variations of projects they're working on, alongside favouring apple products as the technology of choice. I want to utilise this context as a starting point to create a point of interest; to make it interesting.

![design meme](https://www.ipackdesign.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/final-file.jpg)

I want to draw from both the old school mac interface and modern mac os interface to create some sort of parallel effect, maybe a bit dystopian, to draw attention to the variation from the current norm. Creating a bit of comparison, between the interfaces of old school mac os and modern mac os, and also a bit of my own design aesthetic (colour and font choices). It also brings attention to the intentional use of a filing system as an aesthetic. All together creating a bit of a ping-pong"between affect-based judgement and concept-based explanation" to enable interest in the website interface.

> Modern Mac OS.

Getting started on the actual website portfolio, I first created a mock up on Figma, so I could easily and visually plan out how I want the interface to look like before moving onto Github to code it using a combination of html, css and javascript to get it running. I'll be planning to use Github pages to deploy it.

When planning out the landing page, I wanted to include something from both assignment 1 and assignment 2 as kind of like a wrap up to the course and have it visually reflect the network of knowledge learnt over the past semester. Kind of giving the mycelial creativity a visual render. I'm thinking of adding an ever growing gradient circle in the back along with the first version of the moving star spore particles with the connecting lines as I thought they represented my assignment 1 and 2 in a context that also fits in with the visual aesthetic of this assignment the most. Plus, I think it reflects my own design aesthetic the best too (especially the stars).

Colour, I settled for a split complimentary palette; pink, purple and green. I settled for split complimentary as I thought it would provide a more softer and more welcoming version of complimentary as it comes across less harsh. This way it still has high contrast to invite interest, but it wont be so bold that it may come across too aggressive for other users.

I also settled on calling the portfolio pOURtfolio, as I thought it was a punny twist on the word and a way for me to add my own humour and personality on the rather mundane item in contrast.

By the end of the week, I was able to get the website running, I had the landing and a few folder pages working, though I didn't quite have an about page yet. I'm also waiting to see if other friends around me are willing to contribute and share their work and fill in the google form for that. So far I have 4 people that have shared their work.

For one of them - Santino - I also created some visuals following a touch designer [tutorial by Acrylicode](https://youtu.be/G4wyR-Nxyzo?si=uv_n1KhyJyh1TP5w) to create some audio reactive visuals to pair with the sound that he shared. This way it wouldn't just be a big blank page or a little headphone icon slapped in the middle of the page. Instead it'd be more engaging and interesting to view. I also wanted to take this chance to create something in Touch designer as I really enjoyed the touch designer crash course that Minnie gave when she came in for her talk.
