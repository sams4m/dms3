# Homework

### 1. speak to three of your classmates about the [Rafaël Rozendaal](https://www.newrafael.com/internet/ "Link") work you chose last session, and document your discussions on your blog. Ask each of them:

    - what do you think is going on, under the hood?
    - what concepts would I need to understand in order to replicate this work in p5?
    - what resources might help me to learn those concepts?

kunzie:

- 2 circles that keep increasing in size, but the circle only has stroke, no fill.
- changing the size of the circle over time (modulo), to create a gradient
- youtube, p5 resources, google, chat gpt

lam:

- two circles, and every time it respawns a new colour comes out
- smooth gradient colour, how to make the circle grow
- p5 reference, youtube, w3schools

willby:

- two radial gradients on the top and bottom (centre) of the window growing
- colour, division, p5, loops/iterations
- p5 reference, mdn

### 2. take one the concepts from the previous question, and implement it in the [p5 online editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).  Embed your sketch in your blog, detailing how the code is working, and the resources and or communities you engaged with in order to learn about it.
