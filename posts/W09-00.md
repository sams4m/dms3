# Homework

### 1. use¬†[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)¬†or¬†[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)¬†to download three LLMs from different organisations.¬† You might want to use¬†[LiveBench](https://livebench.ai/)¬†and / or¬†[Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/)¬†to help you choose. Run them locally to help you brainstorm some ideas for AT3.¬† Discuss with each of them:

> The domain, repertoire, and values of the communities of practice you are thinking of engaging
> Brainstorm some interesting ways that you might use code to engage those communities
> discuss feasibility, including possible tech stacks and deployment options
> Document these interactions on your blog, along with some additional thoughts comparing and evaluating
>
> - the generated ideas
> - the LLMs themselves

Both Ollama and LM Studio weren't fully working properly for me (ollama was giving me french responses?? and LM studio wouldn't load the LLM's) so I used the web versions on the LLMs instead. The three that I used were: Claude, DeepSeek and Gemini.
I first started by asking the three: "what is the domain, repertoire, and values of uni friends?"
The response I got were pretty similar:

#### Claude

##### Domain of University Friendships

University friendships occupy distinctive spaces and contexts:

- Shared living environments (dorms, apartments, houses)
- Study spaces (libraries, lounges, cafes) where collaborative work happens
- Social gathering spots (campus greens, student unions, local hangouts)
- Digital spaces (group chats, social media, video calls, gaming platforms)
- Extracurricular settings (clubs, sports, student organizations)
- Personal spaces that become communal (dorm rooms that serve as movie nights venues)
- Transitional spaces (walking between classes, dining halls, campus transportation)
- Late-night environments (24-hour study spaces, diners, dorm common areas)

##### Repertoire of University Friendships

University friendships develop characteristic patterns of interaction and support:

- Mutual academic assistance (study groups, proofreading, class selection advice)
- Emotional support through academic and personal challenges
- Shared experiences that become collective memory and inside jokes
- Navigating adult responsibilities together (cooking, budgeting, apartment hunting)
- Celebration rituals for achievements and milestones
- Crisis management (all-nighters, breakups, family issues)
- Identity exploration through dialogue and feedback
- Creating traditions (weekly dinners, annual trips, special occasions)
- Skill-sharing across different backgrounds and majors
- Negotiating boundaries and conflict resolution in close quarters

##### Values of University Friendship

University friendships often embody distinct values shaped by this formative period:

- Authenticity and acceptance during periods of self-discovery
- Reliability amid unpredictable schedules and competing demands
- Mutual growth and encouragement of each other's development
- Flexibility to accommodate evolving identities and interests
- Inclusivity across diverse backgrounds and perspectives
- Vulnerability in sharing uncertainties about future directions
- Loyalty through transitions and geographic separations
- Creating safety nets for risk-taking and experimentation
- Balance between challenging and supporting each other
- Memory-making and experience-gathering as a conscious priority

University friendships are unique in how they form during a period of significant personal transformation. They often function as **chosen family** during a time when students are establishing independence from their families of origin. These friendships frequently navigate tension between depth and breadth (close bonds versus wider social circles), between present enjoyment and future orientation, and between maintaining established friend groups and remaining open to new connections.

###

#### DeepSeek

The¬†**domain**,¬†**repertoire**, and¬†**values**¬†of¬†**university friends**‚Äîthe close social circles formed during higher education‚Äîdiffer from general student life because they center on¬†**shared experiences, emotional bonds, and peer influence**. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

##### Domain (Areas of Activity & Influence)

University friends operate in spaces where¬†**social support, identity exploration, and collective memory**¬†are built:

- **Academic Proximity**:
  - Studying together, sharing notes, cramming for exams.
  - Group projects, lab partners, or studio mates (especially in design/tech fields).
- **Living Spaces**:
  - Dorm life, shared apartments, or off-campus housing.
  - Late-night talks, communal meals, "family-style" bonds.
- **Social & Leisure**:
  - Parties, club outings, road trips, festivals.
  - Gym buddies, coffee runs, thrift shopping, or binge-watching shows.
- **Digital Interaction**:
  - Meme-sharing, TikTok trends, Spotify playlists, gaming (e.g.,¬†*Among Us*,¬†*Valorant*).
  - Group chats (WhatsApp, Discord) for daily banter and emergencies.
- **Crisis & Support**:
  - Venting about stress, breakups, or family issues.
  - Navigating adulthood (taxes, mental health, career anxiety).

##### Repertoire (Skills, Behaviors & Knowledge)

University friendships thrive on¬†**shared rituals, inside jokes, and unspoken rules**:
**Social Skills & Behaviors:**

- **Conflict Navigation**: Resolving disputes over chores, money, or ghosting.
- **Group Dynamics**: Balancing introverts/extroverts, mediator roles.
- **Code-Switching**: Acting differently with friends vs. professors vs. parents.
- **Survival Skills**: - "Borrowing" laundry detergent or instant noodles. - Sneaking into full lectures or guest events.
  **Cultural Capital:**
- **Shared Humour**: References to niche memes, viral campus drama.
- **Taste & Trends**:
  - Music (indie bands, hyperpop, "study lofi").
  - Fashion (thrifted fits, TikTok aesthetics).
- **Academic Hacks**: - "Which professor gives easy A‚Äôs?" - Best libraries for naps vs. grinding.
  **Emotional Intelligence:**
- **Therapy Speak**: Casual use of terms like¬†*boundaries*,¬†*gaslighting*,¬†*burnout*.
- **Vulnerability**: Normalizing struggles with anxiety, loneliness, or imposter syndrome.

##### Values (Core Beliefs & Priorities)

University friendships are shaped by¬†**temporary intensity**‚Äîthey‚Äôre often deep but may fade post-graduation. Key values include:

- **Loyalty & Trust**: Keeping secrets, defending each other in drama.
- **Non-Judgment**: Accepting quirks (e.g., ADHD hyperfixations, niche fandoms).
- **Shared Growth**: Pushing each other to try new things (clubs, travel, activism).
- **Nostalgia-Making**: "This will be a core memory" mindset.
- **Temporary Permissiveness**: Experimenting with identities, relationships, or substances.
- **Class Solidarity**: Bonding over hating the same gen-ed course.

##### Key Differences from Other Friendships

- **Proximity-Driven**: Unlike childhood friends, uni friends are often bonded by¬†**physical closeness**(dorms, classes).
- **Diversity Exposure**: More likely to include people from different cultures, majors, or backgrounds.
- **Expiration Date Aware**: Some friends are "for now," others are "for life."

###

#### Gemini

While I don't have specific information about the domain, repertoire, and values¬†*exclusively*¬†of "uni friends" as a distinct category separate from individual university students, we can infer some aspects based on the understanding of university students in general and the nature of friendships.

##### Domain of Uni Friends:

The domain within which university friends operate overlaps significantly with the individual student domains, but with a focus on shared spaces and experiences:

- **Shared Academic Spaces:**¬†This includes attending the same classes, study groups, library sessions, and academic events.
- **Social Spaces within University:**¬†This involves university clubs, societies, social events, campus hangouts, and potentially shared accommodation.
- **Personal Time and Spaces:**¬†This extends to time spent together outside of formal university activities, which could be in their living environments, local cafes, or other recreational spaces.
- **Digital Spaces:**¬†Online communication through social media, messaging apps, and shared online study tools forms a significant part of their domain.

##### Repertoire of Uni Friends:

The repertoire of university friends centers on the shared skills, knowledge, and abilities they utilise and develop¬†*together*:

- **Collaborative Study Skills:**¬†This includes studying together, sharing notes and resources, explaining concepts to each other, and preparing for exams as a team.
- **Social and Communication Skills:**¬†Navigating social situations within the university, planning and participating in social activities, and supporting each other emotionally.
- **Shared Interests and Hobbies:**¬†Engaging in common interests, whether related to university clubs, sports, arts, or other leisure activities.
- **Problem-Solving and Support Skills:**¬†Helping each other with academic or personal challenges, offering advice, and providing emotional support during stressful times.
- **Networking (Informal):**¬†While not explicitly professional, friends often connect each other to new people and opportunities within the university social sphere.

##### Values of Uni Friends:

The values that underpin university friendships often include:

- **Mutual Support and Trust:**¬†Relying on each other for help, understanding, and emotional support.
- **Shared Experiences and Belonging:**¬†Valuing the time spent together and the sense of community and connection it fosters.
- **Loyalty and Dependability:**¬†Being there for each other in both good times and bad.
- **Honesty and Open Communication:**¬†Sharing thoughts and feelings openly and honestly.
- **Respect for Individuality:**¬†Accepting each other's differences and supporting personal growth.
- **Shared Interests and Enjoyment:**¬†Valuing common passions and having fun together.
- **Academic Support and Encouragement:**¬†Motivating each other to succeed in their studies.

It's important to remember that these are general inferences. The specific domains, repertoires, and values will vary depending on the individuals involved and the nature of their friendships.

While all covered similar core responses, I think out of the three I resonate with Deep Seek a bit more and Gemini the least. It went into a bit more intimate detail on the different aspects of domain, repertoire and values and gave a more 'humane' response and was where I really had an 'Ah yes, I didn't think of that but it's true' reaction.

I was thinking to do a cross over between the closer uni friends circle and RMIT digital media students who I see and interact with a lot, but wouldn't consider a true 'friend' (sort of like outer circle acquaintance/friendship?) as I know there are a lot of creatives all specialising in different fields that would be able to bring different skills on board and wonder what would happen when that all merges. I've already talked to Adrian and Santino when I saw them at the study area if they'd be happy to participate in the assignment (pending future plans for this assignment).

I then also asked DeepSeek about the domain, repertoire and values of Digital Media students. I chose DeepSeek as it seems to be the most insightful and detailed when it comes to response and gives more humane answers and thoughts too.

**Digital Media Design (DMD) students**¬†have a unique domain, repertoire, and set of values shaped by their creative, technical, and industry-focused education. Here‚Äôs a breakdown:

#### Domain (Areas of Activity & Influence)

Digital media design students operate in a hybrid space blending art, technology, and communication:

- **Academic Work**:
  - Studio courses (graphic design, UX/UI, motion graphics, 3D modelling).
  - Software training (Adobe Creative Suite, Figma, Blender, After Effects).
  - Collaborative projects (app design, game development, interactive media).
- **Industry Engagement**:
  - Internships at design studios, tech startups, or advertising agencies.
  - Freelance gigs (logo design, social media content, web design).
  - Hackathons, design sprints, and portfolio reviews.
- **Digital & Social Spaces**:
  - Showcasing work on¬†**Behance, Dribbble, Instagram, ArtStation**.
  - Engaging in online communities (Discord design servers, Reddit‚Äôs r/graphic_design).
  - Following trends (AI tools like MidJourney, AR/VR developments).
- **Extracurriculars**:
  - Design clubs, game jams, film festivals, tech meetups.

#### Repertoire (Skills, Behaviours & Knowledge)

DMD students develop a mix of¬†**hard**¬†and¬†**soft skills**

##### Technical Skills:

- **Visual Design**: Typography, branding, colour theory, layout design.
- **UI/UX & Interaction Design**: Wireframing, prototyping (Figma, Adobe XD), usability testing.
- **Motion & 3D**: Animation (After Effects), 3D modelling (Blender, Cinema 4D).
- **Coding Basics**: HTML/CSS, JavaScript (for web design), Python (for creative coding).
- **Emerging Tech**: AR/VR (Unity, Unreal Engine), AI-assisted design (Runway ML, ChatGPT for ideation).

##### Soft Skills & Behaviours:

- **Critique Culture**: Giving/receiving feedback in studio critiques.
- **Iterative Design**: Rapid prototyping, A/B testing, user-centered thinking.
- **Adaptability**: Learning new tools quickly (e.g., AI updates in Photoshop).
- **Self-Promotion**: Building a personal brand via portfolios and social media.
- **Collaboration**: Working with developers, marketers, and other creatives.

#### Values (Core Beliefs & Priorities)

Digital media design students often prioritise:

- **Creativity & Innovation**: Experimenting with new styles, tools, and mediums.
- **User-Centred Design**: Empathy for accessibility and inclusivity in design.
- **Tech-Savviness**: Staying ahead of software trends (e.g., AI, no-code tools).
- **Portfolio Over Grades**: Real-world projects matter more than academic scores.
- **Work-Life Balance**: Struggling with burnout due to tight deadlines.
- **Ethical Design**: Questioning the impact of design (e.g., dark UX patterns, sustainability).
- **Freelance Freedom vs. Job Stability**: Some prefer gig work; others seek full-time roles at tech firms.

#### Key Differences from General Uni Students

- **More Industry-Focused**: Constantly updating skills for job market demands.

I found it a bit uncanny how well it really pinned down the domain, repertoire and values and how it bought up points I didn't really think of but agreed when I read through them. There definitely is a high level of creativity and innovation between the people that i have met in digital media thus far, and I'm thinking it would be interesting to have all these people collaborate on something more mundane. Before asking DeepSeek again, I've thought of doing a satirical comment on modern day party/clubbing culture. Taking a mundane event that I associate with uni friends and then bringing in the creativity of digital media students to make an interesting comment on 'partying' by pointing out the irony of partying being hyped up as 'fun' but the event being rather boring these days; most people are bird watchers that just stand there with a drink in their hands these days. But it'll be these same people that say partying is so much fun, post in a way that makes it seem super fun, but they'll just stand there the night.

To help with the ideating process, I also asked DeepSeek for ways to use code to engage with the two communities to see if there are any better ideas or as a back up in case this idea falls through and I can't manage to get all the people and tools together to make it happen.

#### DeepSeek's Response:

You can leverage¬†**code**¬†to¬†**engage with university friends**¬†and¬†**digital media design (DMD) students**¬†in fun, creative, and practical ways. Here are some ideas, categorized by purpose:

##### 1. For Social Bonding (Uni Friends)

**Automate Group Chores & Plans**

- **Shared Expense Tracker**¬†(Python + Flask/Django)
  - Split bills, rent, or trip costs fairly.
  - Example: Use¬†`splitwise-api`¬†to automate calculations.
- **Event Scheduler Bot**¬†(Discord.js / Telegram Bot API) - Automatically polls friends for best meetup times. - Example:
  `javascript
    // Discord.js poll command
    client.on('message', message => {
      if (message.content === '!plan') {
        message.reply('When‚Äôs the next hangout? üéØ\n1. Fri\n2. Sat\n3. Sun');
      }
    });
`
  **Nostalgia & Inside Jokes**
- **Meme Generator**¬†(Python + PIL/Pillow)

  - Auto-add captions to inside-joke templates.

  ```python
    from PIL import Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont
    img = Image.open("template.jpg")
    draw = ImageDraw.Draw(img)
    draw.text((10, 10), "When the 3AM study session hits", font=ImageFont.load_default())
    img.save("meme.jpg")
  ```

- **Private Social Network**¬†(React + Firebase)
  - A photo dump app for your squad.

##### 2. For Digital Media Design Students

**Portfolio & Collaboration**

- **Interactive Portfolio**¬†(Three.js + GSAP)
  - Stand out with a 3D/scroll-triggered portfolio.
  ```javascript
  // Three.js starter
  const scene = new THREE.Scene();
  const camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(
    75,
    window.innerWidth / window.innerHeight,
    0.1,
    1000
  );
  const renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer();
  ```
- **Design Feedback Tool**¬†(Figma API + Next.js)
  - Embed live Figma prototypes in a feedback forum.

\*_Creative Coding Projects_

- **Generative Art**¬†(p5.js)

  - Make collaborative art with friends.

  ```javascript
  function setup() {
    createCanvas(800, 800);
    background(220);
    fill(255, 0, 0);
    ellipse(400, 400, 200);
  }
  ```

- **AR Filters**¬†(SparkAR / Lens Studio)
  - Code custom Instagram/Snapchat filters for your friend group.

**Automate Design Workflows**

- **Auto-Resize Graphics**¬†(Python + OpenCV)
  - Batch-process social media assets.
  ```python
  import cv2
  img = cv2.imread("poster.jpg")
  resized = cv2.resize(img, (1080, 1080))  # Instagram size
  cv2.imwrite("poster_IG.jpg", resized)
  ```
- **AI-Assisted Design**¬†(Runway ML API)
  - Generate textures/mockups programmatically.

##### 3. Crossovers (Friends + DMD Students)

**Multiplayer Games & Experiences**

- **Browser-Based Game**¬†(Socket.io + Phaser)
  - Code a trivia game about your friend group.
- **Virtual Gallery**¬†(A-Frame)
  - Showcase DMD students‚Äô work in a VR space.

**Hybrid Social + Design Projects**

- **T-Shirt Design Voting App**¬†(MERN Stack)
  - Friends submit designs, vote on favorites to print.
- **Collaborative Spotify Visualizer**¬†(D3.js + Spotify API)
  - Sync music tastes with real-time graphics.

##### Tools to Learn

| Purpose       | Tech Stack                                    |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Social Bots   | Python (Discord.js, Tweepy)                   |
| Web Apps      | JavaScript (React, Next.js)                   |
| Creative Code | p5.js, Processing, TouchDesigner              |
| Automation    | Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium)              |
| Design-Tech   | Figma API, Three.js, Blender Python Scripting |

##### Key Tips

- **Start small**: Automate a group chat meme first.
- **Use APIs**: Spotify, Discord, or Instagram APIs add interactivity.
- **Collaborate**: Host a GitHub repo for joint coding/design projects.

I think I like the idea of a portfolio as a back up if I can't make the other one work, or if this one is just more feasible to create. But make it a collaborative one. While I didn't include it in the original list, I was thinking to make it about my creative friends around me as a community. Asking everyone to contribute a bit of art or any creative work that represents them to create a collaborative portfolio, kind of like a big pin board that will showcase everyone's creative personality.

In terms of technicality, this one would be more difficult code wise, however would be easier to execute once the logistics and behind the scenes stuff are done considering people can contribute in their own time. Whereas the other idea would be easier to prepare for, but it would be more difficult to get everyone together to execute before the end of semester/the due date of the assignment.

I've happened to talk to Mav in the study area (not very familiar with but have gotten to know from other familiar faces that hang around the study area) who I know is a touch designer wiz, but I also found out dabbles a bit in live coding. He had a project where he combines touch designer, with live coding (inputs using cursor ai to create visuals) and sound. Which I found really cool and would actually work really well with the first idea. I would just need to get to know touch designer and play around with it first - I've never used touch designer before.

### 2. Use¬†[Processing](https://processing.org/)¬†to make a gif

> Start with this¬†[bleuje tutorial](https://bleuje.com/tutorials/)
> Take the core concept and put your own spin on it
> You can use AI to help you with this task
> Post some documentation of your process, along with the final gif and some additional discussion, to your blog

I've very vaguely used processing in the past, but it's been a while (a few years) since I've used it or used java either (quickly realised it was java after downloading and opening the software). Even then, I've never used java for creating shapes and pretty imagery, I've only used it for mathematical computations (like controlling the actions of a robot).

So the first thing I did was search "drawing shapes in java" in google which gave me this from Gemini:

Here is how to draw shapes in Java using the¬†`Graphics`¬†class within a¬†`JPanel`.

- Create a¬†`JPanel`¬†subclass:¬†This panel will be responsible for drawing.¬†Override the¬†`paintComponent`¬†method.

```java
import javax.swing.JPanel;
import java.awt.Graphics;
import java.awt.Color;

public class ShapePanel extends JPanel {
@Override
	public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
		super.paintComponent(g);
		// Drawing code goes here
	}
}
```

- **Draw shapes:**¬†Inside the¬†`paintComponent`¬†method, use the¬†`Graphics`¬†object (g) to draw shapes.

```java
// Draw a rectangle
g.setColor(Color.RED);
g.drawRect(50, 50, 100, 80); // x, y, width, height
g.fillRect(200, 50, 100, 80); // Filled rectangle

// Draw an oval
g.setColor(Color.BLUE);
g.drawOval(50, 150, 100, 50); // x, y, width, height
g.fillOval(200, 150, 100, 50); // Filled oval

// Draw a line
g.setColor(Color.GREEN);
g.drawLine(50, 250, 150, 250); // x1, y1, x2, y2

// Draw an arc
g.setColor(Color.ORANGE);
g.drawArc(50, 300, 100, 100, 0, 180); // x, y, width, height, startAngle, arcAngle
g.fillArc(200, 300, 100, 100, 0, 180); // Filled arc

// Draw a polygon
g.setColor(Color.MAGENTA);
int[] xPoints = {50, 100, 150};
int[] yPoints = {450, 400, 450};
g.drawPolygon(xPoints, yPoints, 3); // xPoints, yPoints, nPoints
g.fillPolygon(xPoints, yPoints, 3); // Filled polygon
```

- Create a¬†`JFrame`¬†to display the panel:

```java
import javax.swing.JFrame;

public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		JFrame frame = new JFrame("Drawing Shapes");
		frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
		frame.setSize(400, 600);
		frame.add(new ShapePanel());
		frame.setVisible(true);
	}
}
```

- **Compile and run:**¬†Compile both¬†`ShapePanel.java`¬†and¬†`Main.java`¬†and run the¬†`Main`¬†class.¬†A window will appear displaying the drawn shapes.

I used this information and applied it to change the point to a star in the rotating point example by bleuje and adjusted some of the colour parameters.

<div id="ver1"></div>

> First version of the script.

I then adjusted the code to add a sinusoidal on the path way and change the colours.

<div id="ver2"></div>

> Second version of the script.

Which I made some final adjusts to.

<div id="ver3"></div>

> Final version of the script.
