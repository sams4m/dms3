# Homework

### 1. use¬†[Ollama](https://ollama.com/)¬†or¬†[LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)¬†to download three LLMs from different organisations.¬† You might want to use¬†[LiveBench](https://livebench.ai/)¬†and / or¬†[Chatbot Arena](https://lmarena.ai/)¬†to help you choose. Run them locally to help you brainstorm some ideas for AT3.¬† Discuss with each of them:

> The domain, repertoire, and values of the communities of practice you are thinking of engaging
> Brainstorm some interesting ways that you might use code to engage those communities
> discuss feasibility, including possible tech stacks and deployment options
> Document these interactions on your blog, along with some additional thoughts comparing and evaluating
>
> - the generated ideas
> - the LLMs themselves

### 2. Use¬†[Processing](https://processing.org/)¬†to make a gif

> Start with this¬†[bleuje tutorial](https://bleuje.com/tutorials/)
> Take the core concept and put your own spin on it
> You can use AI to help you with this task
> Post some documentation of your process, along with the final gif and some additional discussion, to your blog
