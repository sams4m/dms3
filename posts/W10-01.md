# Homework

### 1. choose a scripting language workflow out of the following options:

- [lua5](https://github.com/matiasvlevi/lu5)
- [Art from Code (R](https://art-from-code.netlify.app/)
- [Manim (python)](https://www.manim.community/)
- [Ruby 2D](https://www.ruby2d.com/)
- [Scripting in Unity](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/151099/modules/items/7289368)
- some other scripting language workflow

### 2. find a tutorial series on this approach, and follow along until you understand the basics.

### 3. create a script that demonstrates what you have learned.

### 4. document the process in a blog post discussing:

> - why you are interested in this scripting language
> - how you might use this scripting language in your own creative practice
> - the strengths & weaknesses of this scripting language vs other scripting languages
> - the strengths & weaknesses of scripting languages in general, vs compiled languages

> Chosen Scripting language: Unity in C#

This is a Unity script I had previously written for DMS1 AT3.

The script assumes that the audio source components already have audio assigned and are set to loop, therefore there are no play or stop methods, only update to enable or disable as needed per frame.

```C#
// import unity libraries needed
using System.Collections;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using UnityEngine;

//  ---------------------------------------------------------------- //
// defines 'footsteps' class
// inherits from 'MonoBehaviour' (making it attachable to game objects)
public class footsteps : MonoBehaviour
{
	// declare two public audio source var
	// footstepsSound: plays normal walking sounds
	// sprintSound: plays faster running/sprinting sounds
	// public means all can acces
	// you can drag and drop audiosource components in unity inspector
    public AudioSource footstepsSound, sprintSound;

	// METHOD: update
	// calls per frame
	// checks input continuously
    void Update()
    {
	    // checks if any WASD keys are currently being pressed
	    // == moving
        if(Input.GetKey(KeyCode.W) || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.A) || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.S) || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.D)){
	        // sprint detection
	        // if the player is moving and holding left shift
            if (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftShift))
            {
	            // disable normal footstep sound
                footstepsSound.enabled = false;
                // enable sprint footstep sound
                sprintSound.enabled = true;
            }
            // if moving but not holding Left Shift
            else
            {
	            // enable normal footstep sound
                footstepsSound.enabled = true;
                // disable sprint footstep sound
                sprintSound.enabled = false;
            }
        }
        // if no keys are pressed
        // == not moving
        else
        {
	        // turn off all sound effects
            footstepsSound.enabled = false;
            sprintSound.enabled = false;
        }
    }
}
```

I am interested in Unity as it allows me to create complicated 3d environments, which therefore opens up the possibilities within my creative practice, even if 3d environments isn't my main area of focus. It allows for the possibility of exploring fun side projects outside of my main focus. And I think it's important to continuously expand the techniques and methodologies on hand as it also broadens the breadth of thinking overall, helping to create more meaningful outputs.

Overall, unity is favourable for those looking for a scripting language with game development that handles cross-platform deployment and want a good coding ecosystem integrated; visual integration between code and the visual editor and component based ecosystem. Unity is a pretty popular platform for game development overall, which makes it a favourable scripting language to learn over other ones.
However, while C# in Unity has a strong ecosystem, this can actually also limit the control over things like memory management which hinders performance. It also means it is strictly limited to Unity too.

Comparing to other Python / Lua:

- Unity: better better debugging and developing process of environment, visual editor, performance
- Python/Lua: more flexible, easier to embed, better for scripting existing engines

#### Scripting Languages vs Compiled Language

Scripting languages are good at rapid prototyping, automation; applications where there isn't a need for high speed output.
Compiled languages are good at performance-critical applications; applications where security and direct hardware control is necessary.
