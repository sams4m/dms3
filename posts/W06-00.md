# Homework

Please consider the following javascript libraries:

- [q5.js](https://q5js.org/)
- [c2.js](https://c2js.org/)
- [svg.js](https://svgjs.dev/)

... and attend to the following questions / tasks:

### 1. What is each library for?Â 

> - In what ways are they different?

#### q5.js

Q5 is "Â a small and fast alternative (experimental) implementation of p5.Â js, the client-side JS platform for creative expression on the web"; in other words, sort of like a p5 lite. It is more beginner friendly and powered by WebGPU. Q5 is mostly code-compatible with p5.js, therefore you can swap out library links in a sketch and expect it to work mostly the same without much modification. It inherits most of the positive features from p5, though puts more emphasis on being fast and lightweight in comparison to p5.

At this point in time, q5 supports most of p5's drawing API's, math functionality and other utilities, though works purely in 2D -- it doesn't support 3D yet. They will mostly add 3D later as an extension to keep q5 lightweight. It also excludes DOM and sound functionalities, though, is _mostly_ compatible with p5.sound.js and p5.dom.js

[Reference / guide](https://q5js.org/learn/#coreSection) to q5.js library.

#### c2.js

C2 is a library primarily based on computational geometry, physics simulation, evolutionary algorithms, and other modules. It is written in TypeScript and released as a JavaScript library. The library creates geometric data through the algorithm module. These algorithms have great application in generative design, data visualisation, and sound visualisation.

It currently provides a simple renderer on canvas for rendering, the user can also implement their own renderer based on Canvas, SVG, or WebGL accordingly.

The [references / functions](https://c2js.org/reference.html) that c2.js library provides.

#### SVG.js

Svg.js is a lightweight library for manipulating and animating SVG files/images. It also focuses on being lightweight and fast whilst covering all the SVG specs.

SVG itself has elements and attributes for rectangles, circles, ellipses, lines, polygons, curves, and more. In Javascript it alsoÂ supports filter and blur effects, gradients, rotations, animations, interactivity. This library would bring this to life.

Reference to [manipulate](https://svgjs.dev/docs/3.2/manipulating/) SVGs.
Reference to [animate](https://svgjs.dev/docs/3.2/animating/) SVGs.

### 2. Can we use these libraries from within aÂ [javascript module](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)? Explain why / why not.

> - In what situations might a tool likeÂ [esm.sh](https://esm.sh/)Â be useful?

#### q5.js

Yes and no, it isn't as direct as using for example RiTa, which we used in the last class. The website offers this:

```
<script src="https://q5js.org/q5.js"></script>
```

Which could be added directly into your html file. However, to use directly in a javascript module you'd want to use something that can convert the javascript module link that can be directly imported into your file without any installations or build steps required, and that's when something like the tool mentioned above, esm.sh, may be useful.

#### c2.js

Yes, and no, similar to q5, but can be more straight forward. The website itself offers the download for the whole folder for the library in typescript, and the other files that come with it (examples etc), or you could access the github repo and download either the full cs.js file (located int he dist folder) or get the minified version of the file, c2.min.js (also in the same folder).

You can then use the library by either by first installing via npm, which then you can include to your script to use via:

```
// this code is sourced directly from the c2.js website
// located in "Get Started"

let c2 = require("c2.js");

// you can then do something like
let rect = new c2.Rect(0, 0, 480, 480);
let rects = rect.split([1,2,3,5,8], 'squarify');
```

Or you could import through adding through linking it in the html.

```
// this code is sourced directly from the c2.js website
// located in "Get Started"

// in the body of html, or just body of md
<canvas id='c2'/>
    <script src='main.js'></script>

// in the script tag
let canvas = document.getElementById('c2');
let renderer = new c2.Renderer(canvas);

renderer.size(480, 480);
renderer.background('#cccccc');

// you can then do something like:
let rect = new c2.Rect(0, 0, 480, 480);
let rects = rect.split([1,2,3,5,8], 'squarify');

renderer.draw(() => {
  renderer.clear();

  let mouse = renderer.mouse;
  let point = new c2.Point(mouse.x, mouse.y);
  for (let rect of rects){
    if(rect.contains(point)) renderer.fill('#ff0000');
    else renderer.fill(false);
    renderer.rect(rect);
  }
});
```

Or, like above, you could use esm.sh to package the link up so that it can used directly in the javascript without having to install or build anything.

#### SVG.js

Svg.js proves to be similar to the one above, yes and no. The website's [installation page](https://svgjs.dev/docs/3.2/installation/#cdn-js-jsdelivr) provides multiple options.
You could use npm:

```
npm install @svgdotjs/svg.js
```

Yarn: (Similar to npm it's a package manager for node.js but is developed and handled by facebook)

```
yarn add @svgdotjs/svg.js
```

CDN/JSDeliver: (content deliver network, like esm.sh, is like an online "delivery" service for js libraries: serving web files directly from the npm registry and GitHub repositories without any configuration)

```
// taken from the svg.js website
// CDN.js
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/svg.js/3.2.4/svg.min.js" integrity="sha512-ovlWyhrYXr3HEkGJI5YPXIFYIbHEKs2yfemKVVIIQe9U74tXyTuVdzMlvZlw/0X5lnIDRgtVlckrkeuCrDpq4Q==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></script>

// JSDeliver
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@svgdotjs/svg.js@latest/dist/svg.min.js"></script>
```

You could similarly download the js file directly from the Github repo. These are included in the html body.

Or, like above, you could use esm.sh to package the link up so that it can used directly in the javascript without having to install or build anything.

### 3. Use one of these libraries on your blog to demonstrate how to use a signal or envelope to make something change over time.

<canvas id="q3-canvas" style="margin-bottom:5%;"> </canvas>

> Base code inspired by [Voronoi example](https://github.com/ren-yuan/c2.js/blob/main/examples/Voronoi.js)

### 4. In your own words, please give a brief summary of the following texts:Â
