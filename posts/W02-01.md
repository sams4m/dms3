# Homework

### 1. Please describe the kindred spirit for whom your AT1 is an offering.

    - what is the context of your kinship?
    - what is your common purpose?
    - who or what is your shared challenge / adversary?

### 2. Please expand on your discussions from homework: 2a to explain how your chosen kindred spirit may understand or relate to the visual, sonic, and interactive elements of your AT1 idea.  Please use embedded p5 sketches to help explain your ideas.

### 3. Consider this [p5 recreation](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/9yDsxLFYZ) of [Falling Falling](https://www.fallingfalling.com/), by Rafaël Rozendaal.

    - duplicate the sketch so it exists under your username
    - comment the sketch, demonstrating that you understand what each line of code is doing
    - make a list of the lines of code that you are having trouble understanding
    - list some resources, colleagues (human and non-human), and communities might you reach out to to help you understand these lines of code
    - document your learning journey with words, screenshots, and embedded p5 sketches

### 4. **< b o n u s ~ r o u n d >** Refactor your Falling Falling sketch to use [classes](https://blog.science.family/240312_classes).
