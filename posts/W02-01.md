# Homework

### 1. Please describe the kindred spirit for whom your AT1 is an offering.

> - what is the context of your kinship?
> - what is your common purpose?
> - who or what is your shared challenge / adversary?

I've never really believed in ghosts, but I've always had an interest in ghosts and paranormal stories, myths and such as a kid (kind of like a fantasy fairytale, but instead of your garden gnome it was ghostly entities for me, though in hindsight ghosts can be a garden gnome too?). The hypothetical concept of a bridging connection between the living and afterlife, where even after death a soul can stay in connection with someone or something in the living world because they felt so strongly and had the resilience to feel so strongly seemed fascinating, and to this day I still love how this idea is used and manipulated in media and culture. Even more fascinating when I hear stories from others and kind of encounter it myself (though I still don't believe in ghosts since it just doesn't really make sense from a literal stand point to me, pretty sure I fainted from low blood sugar or something).

I don't think there is much of a common purpose between myself and ghosts, perhaps two worlds colliding? Weirdly enough I think there is an admiration for ghosts because it is absolutely opposite to everything I am.

I think the theoretical "fantasy" concept behind ghostly entities helps encourage my creativity and imagination. I believe I'm a very pragmatic person (it's why I don't really care about food; it's a bonus if delicious but ultimately it's just fuel to sustain me, just needs to be edible and I don't care what it looks like, it's all the same when consumed), and paranormal activity and everything that it stands for contradicts what I believe in. But the fascination encourages me to think outside of the box and "unrealistically", and in a way is an escape from the everyday real world.

### 2. Please expand on your discussions from homework: 2a to explain how your chosen kindred spirit may understand or relate to the visual, sonic, and interactive elements of your AT1 idea.Â  Please use embedded p5 sketches to help explain your ideas.

I think my kindred spirit is something doused in mythical "imaginary" and having something visually unclear, a bit like having a frosted glass in between the two worlds. I think ghosts are often playful too, having a fun texture like noise, blooming shapes that appear sporadically throughout embodies this energy and would be something a ghost would enjoy or be mesmerised by. I'd say the same with having some sort of hide and seek or cat and mouse chase interactivity element to it. I think using a mouse following tactic for X, Y coordinates of shapes would make it feel that way, but keeping the frame rate low to give a floating kind of essence to the interaction would definitely bridge the connection and energy between the two worlds.

Sound wise, I think going with some soft wind chimes would be a great way to connect with the energy of a ghostly spirit. It would provide a sense of calming that would be healing and bridging.

### 3. Consider thisÂ [p5 recreation](https://editor.p5js.org/capogreco/sketches/9yDsxLFYZ)Â ofÂ [Falling Falling](https://www.fallingfalling.com/), by RafaÃ«l Rozendaal.

> - duplicate the sketch so it exists under your username
> - comment the sketch, demonstrating that you understand what each line of code is doing
> - make a list of the lines of code that you are having trouble understanding
> - list some resources, colleagues (human and non-human), and communities might you reach out to to help you understand these lines of code
> - document your learning journey with words, screenshots, and embedded p5 sketches

I didn't have too much trouble understanding the code, especially with the preview on the side in p5. Though there were a few instances where I didn't know the syntax of things but that was easily resolved through using the p5 reference library to understand the use of the values in the functions.

Most the time when I try to understand a code I'd use printf to visualise what is happening in the console alongside the output. If I'm still unsure or just need another layer of confirmation I'll change up variable numbers in the code to help further with the visualisation.

One instance (the end points array) where I wasn't 100% sure what was happening, so I switched up the numbers in the code to visualise the effects changing the number creates when sketched to confirm what I thought was happening.

<img src="/W02/04.jpeg" alt="04.jpeg"/>

Through this process I was able to identify that this calculated the x coordinates (evenly distributed) that the vertices end at.
